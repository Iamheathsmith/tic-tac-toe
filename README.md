This is a game of Tic Tac Toe that is made with React that does not use Redux for state management. The react component are as follows

* Landing page(content)
* Checkbox - for selecting CPU mode
* DisplayBox - for displaying the squares on the page
* Modal - for displaying who has won the game.
* Radio - for selecting the game mode. Either normal or insane


### Lib file

we have 3 different files in my Lib files that do a very basic functions

* Bot.js - this is the CPU to play against you
* Check-winner.js - this is the function to check if there is a winner or stalemate
* utils.js - just has a render function.
